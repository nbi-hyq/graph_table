# graph_table

Using a single quantum emitter one can generate graph states with a caterpillar structure. Using additional linear optics fusions enables generating further graph states. This code can be used for computing a lookup table for graph states that can be generated by a single quantum emitter and a minimum number of type-II fusions.
